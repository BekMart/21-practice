<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

This website has been designed with a consistent layout to create a professional feel, with an easy to use interface on all devices. The layout has been adjusted for users to enjoy on all devices from mobile phones to desktop screens, whilst keeping the general feel consistent and intuitive. 

- The background image is always in the centre of the screen. On mobile devices, less of it is visible but it holds its integrity and on larger screens it ocuppies the whole screen. 
- The title of the page is always at the top centre and has a strong contrast to the background, making it bold and striking.
- There is an area which displays the opponents score and winning tally at the top of the page, which is mirrored at the bottom for the user.
- The cards are dealt to each player next to where their scores are stated, symetrically and seperated by the game control buttons.
- The buttons change depending on the device width. All the buttons are aligned horizontally on a larger device but on smaller devices the deal button is elevated above the other two game control buttons. The settings buttons at the bottom of the page align vertically on smaller devices. 
- All the buttons have a bold contrast to the background and are all styled the same. When the user hovers over the buttons, the colours are inverted and once clicked, the button depreciate to acknowledge this action. 
- The game rules appear as a modal when clicked. The user can click either on the x in the corner or anywhere else on the screen to contnue to the game.

### Colors

I have used consistent and contrasting colours throughout the website, to ensure that all content is readable:

- #163904 (Dark Green)
    - The font colour of text inside the buttons and within the game rules (modal)
    - The background colour when buttons are hovered over as colours become inverted
    - The border of the score areas
    - Outline of the animated results font
- #CFB006 (Gold)
    - The main font colour for the page title
    - The font colour for the game scores
    - Background color for the buttons
    - When buttons are hovered over, the font changes to this colour
- #C20202 (Red)
    - The main title outline
    - The animated font to display the results
- #DDC750 (Lighter Gold)
    - A lighter shade of the other gold used, as the background of the game rules (modal)
